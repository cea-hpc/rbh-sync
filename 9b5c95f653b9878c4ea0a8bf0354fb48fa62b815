      "message": "(talking to myself) actually, convert-\u003eupsert can\u0027t be true here as if there was one it would immediately be consummed, and it can only be true below if convert-\u003elink was false here, so we could save to comparisons on each loop by moving things a bit\n\n... convert_iter_next(...) {\n  if (!convert-\u003elink) {\n    ... _convert_iter_next(convert)...\n    if (convert-\u003eupsert) {\n      ... upsert_new ...\n    }\n  }\n  if (convert-\u003elink) {\n    ... link_new ...\n  }\n}\n\nThat said I think it\u0027s much clearer as code is right now, even if the compiler has no way of possibly optimizing it as I did, the cost of malloc etc is much bigger than these two comparisons and we should keep the code as is... probably.. :P",
