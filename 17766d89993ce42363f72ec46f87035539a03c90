      "message": "Hi Thomas\n\n\u003e This patch is now submitted for quite some time and it\u0027s already at its 14th version, which turns to be discouraging...\n\nUnderstandable.\n\n\u003e Would it be possible to checkpoint this patch at this point, i.e.\n\u003e 1) agree on an initial version of this patch that could be landed right now\n\u003e with no extra work, and which already brings an improvement to the project: better than no test at all.\n\nI have issues with the core test functions, so this is going to be hard.\n\n\u003e 2) identify problematic parts to be removed from this version, and that will require more work, and should be submitted in a later change.\n\nI expect more robust tests + APIs that are pleasant to use and make the code readable/maintainable.\n\nI don\u0027t think I can in good conscience stamp this code as \"good enough\" and merge it. Plus, if I did, I\u0027m certain I would feel compelled to go back to it and fix it on my own time, which I don\u0027t want to do.\n\nBut you have a point: it may be time to take a different approach.\n\nI think my expectation on what makes for good tests in bash are not aligned with yours. That being said, tests in bash are not my main priority either. So long as I don\u0027t have to run the code in my own CI system, I\u0027m OK with it.\n\nMaybe CEA can take the lead on reviewing anything that goes into rbh-find and rbh-sync\u0027s \"tests\" directory? Eventually rbh-fsevents as well if that is something you are interested in.\n\nThat would mean reviewing the code yourself until it is in a merge-able state according to the contributing guidelines [0] and then pinging me. Or also merging the code yourself if you prefer it.\n\nI would like to still review the patches, but if my reviews are to be discarded [1] I\u0027d rather spend the time on something else.\n\n[0] https://github.com/cea-hpc/robinhood/blob/v4/contributing.rst#landing\n[1] no offense taken",

This version should bring FA_RENAME events, which I have been waiting for to implement an fanotify connector.\n\nStill available for reviews of course.",
